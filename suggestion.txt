Suggestion: Base on the simulation I ran I suggest that you focus on making paying staffs like cashiers and ushers for faster customer management. Additionally, you don't need to add multiple server if one server is enough for your operation since it only slows the process and add the cost.

Suggestion: I ran another simulation and I found out that you should prioritize adding more cashiers than ushers since your process tends to get faster with that scenario. Furthermore, adding more server tends to slow down the waiting time. I assume that the reason for this is an additional labor or another time consumption for the process per server.
